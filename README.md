 2. How is the school summary affected?
 
Only the data of Thomas High School is affected because the math and reading scores fell. 

 3. How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores caused Thomas High School to fall out of the top 5 highest graded schools. 

 4. How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

- Math and reading scores by grade

  The math and reading scores in each grade were not visibly affected, however it should be noted that the 9th graders' at Thomas High School had the highest grades   in the district.   

- Scores by school spending

  The small change mentioned above in the average math and reading percentages of the new analysis could be seen in the school spending data, however the drop in score average did not affect the amount of per student spending by Thomas High School.

- Scores by school size

  The overall passing percentage by school size is not changed by removing the 9th graders' scores.

- Scores by school type

  Scores by school type are not affected by removing the 9th graders' scores.

## **Summary**
Four notable changes that occured in the analysis were the following:

1. Thomas High School's ranking fell by eliminating the 9th graders' scores and it was no longer in the top 5 schools in the district.

2. Because the scores of the 9th graders at Thomas High School were removed, it caused all the 9th graders' overall scores to drop.

3. Thomas High School's data is more affected by removing the 9th graders' scores than the district data is. 

4. The 9th graders' scores make a difference in the school's overall grade average and the scores of the other grades (10th - 12th) were not high enough to keep Thomas High School in the top 5.
